## Tuple&lt;T&gt;.operator ==(Tuple&lt;T&gt;, Tuple&lt;T&gt;) Operator
Evaluates whether the item in the tuple is the same.  
```csharp
public static bool operator ==(KeepCoding.Tuple<T> tupleA, KeepCoding.Tuple<T> tupleB);
```
#### Parameters
<a name='KeepCoding_Tuple_T__op_Equality(KeepCoding_Tuple_T__KeepCoding_Tuple_T_)_tupleA'></a>
`tupleA` [KeepCoding.Tuple&lt;](KeepCoding_Tuple_T_.md 'KeepCoding.Tuple&lt;T&gt;')[T](KeepCoding_Tuple_T_.md#KeepCoding_Tuple_T__T 'KeepCoding.Tuple&lt;T&gt;.T')[&gt;](KeepCoding_Tuple_T_.md 'KeepCoding.Tuple&lt;T&gt;')  
The left-hand side comparison.
  
<a name='KeepCoding_Tuple_T__op_Equality(KeepCoding_Tuple_T__KeepCoding_Tuple_T_)_tupleB'></a>
`tupleB` [KeepCoding.Tuple&lt;](KeepCoding_Tuple_T_.md 'KeepCoding.Tuple&lt;T&gt;')[T](KeepCoding_Tuple_T_.md#KeepCoding_Tuple_T__T 'KeepCoding.Tuple&lt;T&gt;.T')[&gt;](KeepCoding_Tuple_T_.md 'KeepCoding.Tuple&lt;T&gt;')  
The right-hand side comparison.
  
#### Returns
[System.Boolean](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean 'System.Boolean')  
True if tupleA.Item1.Item1 and tupleB.Item1.Item1 are equal.
