## GeneratorSetting.FrontFaceOnly Property
Force modules to be placed only on the front face. By default this will limit the module count to 5 (+1 for the timer). Useful in rare circumstances where you wish to generate a bomb with a few modules and guarantee that they will all be visibile simultaneously.  
```csharp
public bool FrontFaceOnly { get; }
```
#### Property Value
