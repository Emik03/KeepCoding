## BigInteger.IsBetween(BigInteger, BigInteger) Method
Determines if it is between 2 other [BigInteger](KeepCoding_BigInteger.md 'KeepCoding.BigInteger') variables. Equality will count as true.  
```csharp
public bool IsBetween(KeepCoding.BigInteger min, KeepCoding.BigInteger max);
```
#### Parameters
<a name='KeepCoding_BigInteger_IsBetween(KeepCoding_BigInteger_KeepCoding_BigInteger)_min'></a>
`min` [BigInteger](KeepCoding_BigInteger.md 'KeepCoding.BigInteger')  
The minimum value accepted.
  
<a name='KeepCoding_BigInteger_IsBetween(KeepCoding_BigInteger_KeepCoding_BigInteger)_max'></a>
`max` [BigInteger](KeepCoding_BigInteger.md 'KeepCoding.BigInteger')  
The maximum value accepted.
  
#### Returns
[System.Boolean](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Boolean 'System.Boolean')  
True if [min](KeepCoding_BigInteger_IsBetween(KeepCoding_BigInteger_KeepCoding_BigInteger).md#KeepCoding_BigInteger_IsBetween(KeepCoding_BigInteger_KeepCoding_BigInteger)_min 'KeepCoding.BigInteger.IsBetween(KeepCoding.BigInteger, KeepCoding.BigInteger).min') is smaller or equal itself and [max](KeepCoding_BigInteger_IsBetween(KeepCoding_BigInteger_KeepCoding_BigInteger).md#KeepCoding_BigInteger_IsBetween(KeepCoding_BigInteger_KeepCoding_BigInteger)_max 'KeepCoding.BigInteger.IsBetween(KeepCoding.BigInteger, KeepCoding.BigInteger).max') is greater or equal itself.
