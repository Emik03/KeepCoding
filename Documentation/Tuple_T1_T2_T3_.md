| Constructors | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Tuple()](Tuple_T1_T2_T3__Tuple().md 'KeepCoding.Tuple&lt;T1,T2,T3&gt;.Tuple()') | Creates a singleton tuple of default values.<br/> |

| Properties | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Item3](Tuple_T1_T2_T3__Item3.md 'KeepCoding.Tuple&lt;T1,T2,T3&gt;.Item3') | The third item of the tuple.<br/> |
