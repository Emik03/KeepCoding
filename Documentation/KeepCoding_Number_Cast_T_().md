## Number.Cast&lt;T&gt;() Method
Casts the [Number](KeepCoding_Number.md 'KeepCoding.Number') into the numeric type. Unlike implicit casting, the value will trim the bytes that cannot occupy the new datatype, such as a number being too large or decimals.  
```csharp
public T Cast<T>();
```
#### Type parameters
<a name='KeepCoding_Number_Cast_T_()_T'></a>
`T`  
  
#### Returns
[T](KeepCoding_Number_Cast_T_().md#KeepCoding_Number_Cast_T_()_T 'KeepCoding.Number.Cast&lt;T&gt;().T')  
Itself as [T](KeepCoding_Number_Cast_T_().md#KeepCoding_Number_Cast_T_()_T 'KeepCoding.Number.Cast&lt;T&gt;().T').
